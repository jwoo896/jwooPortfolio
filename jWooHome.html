				So a little bit about myself. My name is Jae Whan Woo, but I go by Joseph or Joe! I have a love for computers and information technology. I built my PC desktop in 2014. I picked out the parts that I did to specialize it in video gaming. 

				I've been trouble shooting computers since I was in high school, mostly for my parents. I was able to develop these skills further while I was interning at ADG Creative. I interned there as a system administrator for 11 months. It was a great experience and I've learned a great deal while I was there.

				My experience at ADG made me realize that I can pursue my passion if I put in the effort, that passion being web development! I was very fortunate to have met the people that I did. While I had been self-studying back-end development for a year prior, the members of the dev team were very helpful and taught me many things regarding the processes behind web development that I would not have been able to find online.

				Other than that, I also have a love for music. I picked up the guitar when I was 12 years old and have been playing casually ever since. When I turned 19, however, I decided to take it a tad more seriously and started to learn fingerstyle pieces! I produce covers of pieces that I really enjoy listening to and share videos with friends and family! You can view these videos <a href="">here</a> if you'd like! 

				That's pretty much what I'm all about. My skills and interests, at least. If you think I'd be an asset to your dev team please reach out via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jae-whan-joseph-woo-307547111?trk=hp-identity-name">linkedin</a> account or email me at jwoo896@gmail.com. Thank you for checking out my portfolio page!
